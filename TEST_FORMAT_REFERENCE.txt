=== QUICK REFERENCE: JSON FORMAT ===

The JSON structure includes General Stats that appear in the summary output:

{
    "team a": "<team_name>",
    "team b": "<team_name>",
    "events": [
        {
            "event name": "<event_type>",
            "time": <timestamp_in_seconds>,
            "event owner": "",  // Empty - will be filled by system
            
            // GENERAL GAME STATS (shown in output)
            "general game updates": {
                "active": "true|false",
                "before halftime": "true|false"
            },
            
            // TEAM A STATS (shown in output)
            "team a updates": {
                "goals": "<number>",
                "yellow cards": "<number>",
                "red cards": "<number>",
                "possession": "<percentage>"
            },
            
            // TEAM B STATS (shown in output)
            "team b updates": {
                "goals": "<number>",
                "yellow cards": "<number>",
                "red cards": "<number>",
                "possession": "<percentage>"
            },
            
            "description": "<event_description>"
        }
    ]
}

=== TEST DATA FILES CREATED ===

1. test_game.json
   - 3 events: kickoff (0s), Germany goal (1980s), Japan goal (4500s)
   - Final stats: Germany 1-1 Japan
   - Use for reporter1

2. test_game_updates.json
   - 3 events: yellow card (2500s), substitution (3200s), goal (4800s)
   - Different event times and updates from reporter1
   - Use for reporter2

3. test_game_final.json
   - 3 events: yellow card (5200s), red card (6100s), goal (6800s)
   - Final score Japan 2-1 Germany with red card incident
   - Use for reporter3

=== MULTI-USER TEST ===

Each user reports different events. The summary command filters by event_owner,
so each user sees ONLY their own reported events:

- reporter1 reports 3 events → output_reporter1.txt shows those 3 events
- reporter2 reports 3 events → output_reporter2.txt shows those 3 events  
- reporter3 reports 3 events → output_reporter3.txt shows those 3 events

All files should show Germany vs Japan header and stats reflecting their own reports.
