=== CROSS-USER EVENT QUERYING ===

The summary command syntax:
  summary <channel> <targetUser> <output_file>

The <targetUser> parameter specifies WHOSE events you want to see,
not WHO is requesting them. So any user can query any other user's events!

==============================================================================
=== TEST: Reporter1 Querying All Users' Events ===
==============================================================================

TERMINAL 1: First, all three users submit their reports
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

REPORTER1:
.\bin\StompWCIClient.exe
  login 127.0.0.1:7777 reporter1 pass123
  join Germany_Japan
  report client/data/test_game.json
  exit

REPORTER2:
.\bin\StompWCIClient.exe
  login 127.0.0.1:7777 reporter2 pass456
  join Germany_Japan
  report client/data/test_game_updates.json
  exit

REPORTER3:
.\bin\StompWCIClient.exe
  login 127.0.0.1:7777 reporter3 pass789
  join Germany_Japan
  report client/data/test_game_final.json
  exit

==============================================================================
=== TERMINAL 2: Reporter1 Queries Different Users ===
==============================================================================

.\bin\StompWCIClient.exe
  login 127.0.0.1:7777 reporter1 pass123
  join Germany_Japan
  
  # Get reporter1's own events
  summary Germany_Japan reporter1 r1_own_events.txt
  
  # Get reporter2's events (reporter1 is still logged in as reporter1)
  summary Germany_Japan reporter2 r2_events_queried_by_r1.txt
  
  # Get reporter3's events (reporter1 is still logged in as reporter1)
  summary Germany_Japan reporter3 r3_events_queried_by_r1.txt
  
  exit

==============================================================================
=== EXPECTED OUTPUT FILES ===
==============================================================================

r1_own_events.txt:
  Germany vs Japan
  [3 events at times: 0, 1980, 4500]
  [Stats from reporter1's last event]

r2_events_queried_by_r1.txt:
  Germany vs Japan
  [3 events at times: 2500, 3200, 4800]
  [Stats from reporter2's last event]
  ← But requested BY reporter1!

r3_events_queried_by_r1.txt:
  Germany vs Japan
  [3 events at times: 5200, 6100, 6800]
  [Stats from reporter3's last event]
  ← But requested BY reporter1!

KEY POINT: The files contain events from different users (reporter2, reporter3)
even though they were all requested by reporter1!

==============================================================================
=== HOW THE FILTERING WORKS ===
==============================================================================

In client/src/StompProtocol.cpp line 167:

    // targetUser is the 2nd argument of the summary command
    // (passed by the user, not based on who issued the command)
    
    for (const Event& e : events) {
        if (e.get_event_owner() == targetUser) {
            userEvents.push_back(e);
        }
    }

So:
- Reporter1 executes: summary Germany_Japan reporter2 output.txt
- targetUser = "reporter2" (from the command argument)
- System filters events WHERE event_owner == "reporter2"
- Reporter1 gets reporter2's events, not their own!

==============================================================================
=== PRACTICAL USE CASES ===
==============================================================================

1. SPORTS OFFICIAL (Reporter1) verifies data from multiple reporters:
   ✓ summary Germany_Japan reporter2 verify_r2.txt
   ✓ summary Germany_Japan reporter3 verify_r3.txt
   ✓ Compare all reports in one terminal

2. DATA AUDITING:
   ✓ Check consistency: Do all reporters see the same game progression?
   ✓ Verify timestamps: Do events occur in logical order?
   ✓ Cross-validate: Do team stats match across reports?

3. HISTORICAL REVIEW:
   ✓ Query past reporter data
   ✓ Pull specific user's game records
   ✓ Generate summary reports per reporter

==============================================================================
=== VERIFICATION SCENARIO ===
==============================================================================

After all three users report, reporter1 runs:

summary Germany_Japan reporter1 output.txt
  → Contains 3 events (0, 1980, 4500)

summary Germany_Japan reporter2 output.txt
  → Contains 3 DIFFERENT events (2500, 3200, 4800)

summary Germany_Japan reporter3 output.txt
  → Contains 3 DIFFERENT events (5200, 6100, 6800)

SUCCESS: Each command returns DIFFERENT events based on the requested username,
regardless of who issued the command!

==============================================================================
=== IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE ===
==============================================================================

This assumes the protocol is designed to allow users to query any user's data.
If the assignment requires users to only see their OWN events, you would need:

  - Server-side filtering: Server compares logged-in user with requested user
  - Client-side validation: Client only allows querying own username
  
Check your assignment specification for access control requirements!

Current implementation allows any user to query any other user's events.
If this is NOT intended, the filtering logic needs to be moved to the server.
